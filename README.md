My very first web application created, using React.

To note:
- There is no storage of tasks at the moment, tasks will disappear on refresh.
- I no longer use CRA to build apps. Use Vite instead, if you are starting out with React.
- Additional reads:
    - Dump CRA: https://dev.to/ag2byte/create-react-app-is-officially-dead-h7o
    - USE VITE: https://vitejs.dev/guide/ (to learn React)
    - Then move to Next.js: https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations (amazing for production-level apps)

Thanks for all the forks! ðŸ’–
